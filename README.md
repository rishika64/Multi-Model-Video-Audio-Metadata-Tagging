# Multi Model Video Audio Metadata Tagging
Videos and audio files are full of information, but it can be challenging to find and use without metadata. Multi-model video and audio metadata tagging is an innovative approach for automating the tagging process using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

This project is used for metadata generation and classification using machine learning algorithms.
It inputs video language and categorizes them into 30 categories like Space, Animation, Launch, etc. in a CSV file. It works on the VGG-19 Convolutional Neural Network to classify video.
